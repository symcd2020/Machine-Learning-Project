## Overview of the project and its purpose
For this project, our team is looking at the average life expectancy by country. "Life expectancy at birth reflects the overall mortality level of a population. It is the average number of years that a person may expect to live, from birth to death."

"There are 195 countries in the world today. The total comprises 193 countries that are member states of the United Nations and 2 countries that are non-member observer states." Our data looks at 195 countries. 

The purpose of the project is to be able to identify average life expectancies over the years for each country. You can see the changes over time and sexes. You can also see the the average life expectancies by continents. Additionally, you can see the countries with the highest and lowest life expectancies. 

## Data
Our dataset consists of 15 variables and 12,795 observations with TARGET, ResidualSugar, Chlorides, FreeSulfurDioxide, TotalSulfurDioxide, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol, and STARS variables containing several missing values. Lastly, LabelAppeal, AcidIndex, and STARS are discrete variables and the rest are continuous. As such we will perform the appropriate visualization in the following figures.
