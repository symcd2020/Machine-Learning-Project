# Wine Quality determined by Label Appeal

Gourp Members: Mercedes Allen, Lori Bissell, Demetria Horton, Shelby McDaniel, Elcia Wesley

## Overview 
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand the impact of Label Appeal and the STARS rating system on the perceived quality of wine. By leveraging these discrete variables, we aim to identify trends and patterns that influence consumer perception and acceptance.


## Data
Our dataset consists of 15 variables and 12,795 observations with TARGET, ResidualSugar, Chlorides, FreeSulfurDioxide, TotalSulfurDioxide, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol, and STARS variables containing several missing values. Lastly, LabelAppeal, AcidIndex, and STARS are discrete variables and the rest are continuous. As such we will perform the appropriate visualization in the following figures.

## Key Variables
- **Label Appeal**: Reflects the attractiveness of wine labels.
- **STARS**: Indicates quality ratings given to wines, which may influence consumer decisions and perceptions of quality.

## Objectives
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and preprocessed data to handle missing values.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Provide summaries of the main characteristics of Label Appeal and STARS.
- **Correlation Study**: Investigated the relationships between Label Appeal, STARS, and the TARGET quality measure.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Developed models to predict wine quality based on visual appeal and expert ratings.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Tackled missing values through imputation methods to maintain data integrity.
2. **Statistical Summary**: Analyzed the central tendencies and dispersion of Label Appeal and STARS.
3. **Visualization**: Created visual representations to understand the distribution and impact of key variables on wine quality.
4. **Model Development**: Utilized regression or classification techniques to model the influence of Label Appeal and STARS on the perceived wine quality.

## Expected Outcomes
The analysis will highlight the importance of label design and expert ratings in shaping consumer perceptions of wine quality. Insights derived from this study will guide strategic enhancements in marketing and product design.

## Visualizations
Charts and plots will be used to illustrate:
- Distributions of Label Appeal and STARS.
- Correlations with the TARGET variable, indicating overall quality.
- Relationship between Label Appeal, STARS, and Alcohol Content.

## Conclusion
Label Appeal DOES have an impact on STARS rating/ quality of wine. 
- Key Findings
  - Alcohol content has also has an impact on STARS (quality) wine.
  - Label Appeal ALONE is NOT THE BEST indicator of Quality.

Module Usability 
By understanding the interplay between label appeal and STARS ratings, wine producers can tailor their marketing and product strategies to better meet consumer expectations and enhance brand perception.
